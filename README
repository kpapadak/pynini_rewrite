# Pynini rewriter library, v. 0.1

This is a simple set of two Python modules for applying rewrite rules that deals with many of the pitfalls that may arise. The `rewrite` module contains functions for applying a single rule; the `rule_cascade` module provides a class which can be used to apply multiple rules, using `rewrite` as a backend.
